Hello people,
First 10x for letting me be a part of these vast comunity .
Now I need some serious help . I get the error from my desciption on my 8 cards RIG after an upgrate on Win 10 .
Don't know why is making upgrades when all posible ways in my opinion where DISABLE , anyhow the problem is that when I set the RIg to mine 
of course after unninstalling prope (DDU ) for the driver and reinstall CUDA driver for my 8 Nvidida 1070 (7 pieces ) and 1070ti (1 piece ), I get that error and the 1070 ti is not mining even do my OS does recognize the card . I even took out the razer and the cable supply . Somebody believe that he has an idea of what to do before trying to reinstall the win10 ? 
Thanks in advance hope the here soon from any .Still don't know how to upload the screenshot . Sorry about it .
Best regards ,
Paul Horatiu Ardelean Smela .
